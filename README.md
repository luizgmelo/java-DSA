A repository that contains my algorithms and Data Structures made in java.

## Data Strcutures

### ArrayList
An array is a data structure, but an ArrayList is an API that makes the process of using arrays more simple because we do not worry about the size is full or "null" elements when we remove an element.

### Stack
Stack is a linear data structure that uses the principle LIFO (Last-In-First-Out). It behaver like a stack of books, where the first book added to the table is the last to be removed.
